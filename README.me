# SmaliCode-Exploiter

The SmaliCode Exploiter is a program that decompiles APK-Files of Android Apps and reveals the byte-code in .smali format.

## Installation

This program was developed using *Java 11* on *Linux*. The installation of *apktool 2.4.0* is necessary via 
```bash
sudo apt install apktool
```

## Usage

As the main-Method is located in *SmaliExploiter.java*, this Class has to be compiled with the java-Compiler.
For executing the Program, the directory containing the APK needs to be passed as an argument
```bash
cd src/
javac SmaliExploiter.java
java SmaliExploiter ../testAPK1/
```

## Background Information

As Android APKs contain *.dex* files, which are binary Dalvik bytecodes, that the machine can understand. 
To analyze the code in a human readable format, the APK can be decompiled into a format called Smali, 
which has many similarities to Assemblercode. This [documentation] (http://pallergabor.uw.hu/androidblog/dalvik_opcodes.html)
is a guideline for interpreting the .smali format.
