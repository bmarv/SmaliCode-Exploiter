# SmaliCode-Exploiter

The SmaliCode Exploiter is a program that decompiles APK files of Android Apps and reveals the byte-code in .smali format.
The source files of an Android App normally are not visible as they are compiled into an APK file. By decompiling it into 
the .smali format, the files can be analyzed for security vulnerabilities especially regarding falsely declared *Intents*.
As an output, this program inspects the Android-Manifest file besides other data for *Intents, Broadcasts* and *Permissions*
and gives an overview.

## Background Information

Android APKs contain *.dex* files, which are binary Dalvik bytecodes, that the machine can understand. 
To analyze the code in a human readable format, the APK can be decompiled into a format called Smali, 
which has many similarities to Assemblercode. This [documentation] (http://pallergabor.uw.hu/androidblog/dalvik_opcodes.html)
is a firm guideline for interpreting the .smali format.

## Installation

This program was developed using *Java 11* on *Linux*. The installation of *apktool 2.4.0* on Linux/Ubuntu is necessary via 
```bash
sudo apt install apktool
```

## Usage

As the main-Method is located in *SmaliExploiter.java*, this Class has to be compiled with the java-Compiler.
For executing the Program, the directory containing the APK needs to be passed as an argument
```bash
cd src/
javac SmaliExploiter.java
java SmaliExploiter ../testAPK1/
```
